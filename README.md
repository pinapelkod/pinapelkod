- 👋 Hi, I’m @pinapelkod
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Tech. I tend to think of myself as a tech generalist and have worked for 8+ years as a business technology analyst providing techinical services ranging from techinical business requirements gathering, agile project management, process automation, report development, and technical support. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development with the hope of transitioning to a freelance role in the near future. For the sake of accountability I have set a date of **3/12/2021** to my first freelance paying gig. Wish me luck 🤞
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any tech project that would help me dig deeper into the world of freelance full stack web development.
- 📫 You can reach me via pinapelkod@gmail.com
